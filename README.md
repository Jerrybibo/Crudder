# Crudder

**Crudder** is a simple web utility for inventory tracking and management.

This project was created and submitted as part of the Shopify Developer Intern Challenge.

## Important notes

`repl.it` does not play nicely with the code sample when it is executed within their environment.

There is currently a `repl.it` bug that prevents the redirect in the Edit function from working;
please use `repl.it`'s "Open in a new tab" option to open the project in a new browser tab.

## Things I would like to add
* Figure out ways to make the sentence-based (simple) shipment interface a little more user-friendly
* Break up `app.py` into smaller files + files based on each route's functionality
* Increase efficiency of `shipments_advanced()` by using a dictionary
